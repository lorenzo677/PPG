	Abstract = {Photoplethysmography (PPG) is used to estimate the skin blood flow using infrared light. Researchers from different domains of science have become increasingly interested in PPG because of its advantages as non-invasive, inexpensive, and convenient diagnostic tool. Traditionally, it measures the oxygen saturation, blood pressure, cardiac output, and for assessing autonomic functions. Moreover, PPG is a promising technique for early screening of various atherosclerotic pathologies and could be helpful for regular GP-assessment but a full understanding of the diagnostic value of the different features is still lacking. Recent studies emphasise the potential information embedded in the PPG waveform signal and it deserves further attention for its possible applications beyond pulse oximetry and heart-rate calculation. Therefore, this overview discusses different types of artifact added to PPG signal, characteristic features of PPG waveform, and existing indexes to evaluate for diagnoses.},

	abstract={iPhysioMeter is a new smartphone application ("App") for the Apple iPhone and iPod touch that allows photoplethysmography (PPG) to be implemented without the need for any additional devices. The resulting signal, the photoplethysmogram, allows the calculation of basic but valuable and frequently used physiological indices such as heart rate (HR) and pulse volume (PV). The design of iPhysioMeter has very much been influenced by a consideration of usability, as is immediately evident from ones first experience with it. However, its apparent simplicity in use should not disguise the need for correct operation, which otherwise might lead to collection of invalid or inaccurate data. There are several unexpected pitfalls that might not only produce inaccurate values, but, under some circumstances, could also damage the device or present a hazard to the user or subject. We therefore describe here, firstly, the core technology that makes it possible to perform PPG and to calculate HR and normalized PV (NPV) from the photoplethysmogram using only a smartphone, secondly, the correct and optimum methods and procedures for using iPhysioMeter that will help to ensure safety and the derivation of valid data under real operational conditions. We hope that these descriptions will help facilitate any activities related to physiological measurement when using only a smartphone.},

	abstract = {Arterial stiffness due to vascular aging is a major indicator during the assessment of cardiovascular risk. In this study, we propose a method for age estimation by applying deep learning to a photoplethysmogram (PPG) for the non-invasive assessment of the vascular age. The proposed deep learning-based age estimation model consists of three convolutional layers and two fully connected layers, and was developed as an explainable artificial intelligence model with Grad-Cam to explain the contribution of the PPG waveform characteristic to vascular age estimation. The deep learning model was developed using a segmented PPG by pulse from a total of 752 adults aged 20--89 years, and the performance was quantitatively evaluated using the mean absolute error, root-mean-squared-error, Pearson's correlation coefficient, and coefficient of determination between the actual and estimated ages. As a result, a mean absolute error of 8.1 years, root mean squared error of 10.0 years, correlation coefficient of 0.61, and coefficient of determination of 0.37, were obtained. A Grad-Cam, used to determine the weight that the input signal contributes to the result, was employed to verify the contribution to the age estimation of the PPG segment, which was high around the systolic peak. The results of this study suggest that a convolutional-neural-network-based explainable artificial intelligence model outperforms existing models without an additional feature detection process. Moreover, it can provide a rationale for PPG-based vascular aging assessment.},
